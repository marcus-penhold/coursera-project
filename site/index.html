<div><p>The Fool represents new beginnings, having faith in the future, being inexperienced, not knowing what to expect, having beginners luck, improvisation, believing that the Universe provides, having no strings attached, being carefree. The Fool can represent a child or to be childlike, and to have an open mind.

The Fool is also a lucky card, and when it shows up for you, it can mean you are about to be in the right place at the right time, win a competition and/or travel somewhere you have never been before.</p></div>

<div class="header"><p>Fool tarot card meanings reversed</p></div>
<div><p>Fool reversed indicates new beginnings being blocked, the path is hidden and the seeker is having difficulties seeing the world with fresh eyes. You might be feeling stuck and uninspired when the Fool turns up reversed. Some might get lost in their heads, and be losing touch with reality. Lost in the dream and unable to manifest and grow in the physical plane. This card denotes the ones that are young at heart and who are often highly sensitive. They are in touch with their inner child and can get wounded quite easily (like children often do). They are still growing up you might say and have a lot still to learn. If this card shows up reversed for you in a reading it is not a great time for you to begin something new. Take a step back and go back to something you know really well (do what you know, go where you have been before etc). Bid your time for a better result before leaping into the unknown.</p></div>
